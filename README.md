# TrollingMotorBluetoothInput
A project using an Arduino Uno Board, a HC-05 6 pin Bluetooth Module, and a MD30C Motor Driver. For this project, I will modify my dad's Trolling Motor to be operated using an app on his Android via Bluetooth.

The open source Arduino editor is being used to program the Uno, and Android studio is being used to develop mobile android application.

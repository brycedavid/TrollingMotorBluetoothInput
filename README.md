# TrollingMotorBluetoothInput
A project using an Arduino Uno Board along with HC-05 6 pin Bluetooth Module. For this project, I will modify my dad's Trolling Motor to be operated using Bluetooth from an android app.

The open source Arduino editor is used to program the Uno, and Android studio is used to develop mobile android application.
